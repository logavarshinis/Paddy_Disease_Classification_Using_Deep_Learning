# Paddy_Disease_Classification_Using_Deep_Learning
Paddy leaf disease classification uses deep learning to identify diseases like bacterial blight and brown spot from leaf images. A CNN model, trained on labeled images, learns unique disease features to accurately classify them. This technology enables quick diagnosis and treatment, helping farmers improve crop health and yield.
